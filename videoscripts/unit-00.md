**Narration**:
"First, what is an agent? An agent is an AI system that can use tools and take actions. Unlike a basic model that just answers questions, agents can remember context, call external functions, and make decisions. Think of it as the difference between a chatbot and a smart assistant."

Third: Save your Hugging Face token as a repository secret called HF_TOKEN. Your trainer will verify this step."
