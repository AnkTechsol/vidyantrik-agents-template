# Unit 1: Introduction & Setup

Welcome to Unit 1 of the Hugging Face Agents Course! In this unit, we will cover the foundational concepts of AI Agents and get your environment set up.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
-   **Define** what an AI Agent is and how it differs from a standard LLM or Assistant.
-   **Authenticate** with the Hugging Face Hub to access open-source models.
-   **Build** your first simple agent using the `smolagents` library.
-   **Create** and **use** custom tools (like a calculator) with your agent.

## Contents

1.  **[01_hello_agent.ipynb](./01_hello_agent.ipynb)**: Your first steps. We explain the core concepts and run a basic "Hello World" agent.
2.  **[02_understanding_tools.ipynb](./02_understanding_tools.ipynb)**: We introduce the concept of "Tools" and show how to equip your agent with a custom calculator tool.
3.  **[tool_calculator.py](./tool_calculator.py)**: A simple Python script containing the calculator tool used in the second notebook.

## Setup Instructions

1.  Navigate to this folder:
    ```bash
    cd unit-01
    ```

2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
