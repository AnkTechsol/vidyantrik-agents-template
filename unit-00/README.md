# Unit 0 — Introduction & Setup

**Built for Vidyantrik by Anktechsol**

## Overview

Welcome to Unit 0. Get your environment ready and learn agent basics.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what an "agent" is
- Set up GitHub fork from anktechsol/vidyantrik-agents-template
- Create Hugging Face account and link it
- Run minimal "hello agent" notebook

## What You'll Learn

### What are agents?

Agents are AI systems that interact with their environment to achieve goals. Unlike standard models that just answer questions, agents can use tools, remember context, and take actions.

Four basic components:
- **Prompt**: Instructions given to the agent
- **Tool**: External capabilities the agent can use
- **Memory**: Context the agent retains
- **Action**: Steps the agent takes

### Agent vs Assistant vs Model

- **Model**: Basic AI that processes input and generates output
- **Assistant**: Model with conversation memory
- **Agent**: Assistant that can use tools and take actions

## Labs
